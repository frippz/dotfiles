# dotfiles â€“ frippz style

I LOVE MY DOTFILES!!!

## Usage

Make sure you're running `zsh` first (which means that it also needs to be installed, yes), since most of my dotfiles assumes this.

```zsh
$ chsh -s $(which zsh)
```

We're ready to bootstrap!

```zsh
$ script/bootstrap
```

Run the install script afterwards.

```zsh
$ script/install
```

All done! Unless something went wrong, then go ahead and curseâ€¦ ðŸ˜–
