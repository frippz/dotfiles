# dotfiles â€“ frippz style

I don't think it's a good idea for you to fork this. I'm very special. ðŸ˜‰

## Usage

Make sure you're running `zsh` first, since most of my dotfiles assumes this.

```zsh
$ chsh -s /bin/zsh
```

We're ready to bootstrap!

```zsh
$ script/bootstrap
```

Run the install script afterwards.

```zsh
$ script/install
```

All done!

## Thanks

My thanks goes to [Zach Holman](https://github.com/holman) since it was his [holman/dotfiles](https://github.com/holman/dotfiles) that I initally forked. Somewhere along the way, I wiped my git repo and started from scratch, but I'm still using his bootstrap and install scripts, so thanks are in order.

I also regularly snatch goodies from my good friend [Joacim LÃ¶wgren](https://github.com/jlowgren) and his [jlowgren/dotfiles](https://github.com/jlowgren/dotfiles), so some cred goes to him as well. ðŸ˜Š
