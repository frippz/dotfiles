# dotfiles â€“ frippz style

I don't think it's a good idea for you to fork this. I'm very special. ðŸ˜‰

## Usage

```zsh
$ script/bootstrap
```

Not running zsh?

```zsh
$ chsh -s /bin/zsh
```

## Thanks

My thanks goes to @holman since it was his holman/dotfiles that I initally forked. Somehwere along the way, I wiped my git repo and started from scratch, but I'm still using his bootstrap and install scripts, so thanks are in order.

I also regularly snatch goodies from my good friend @jlowgren and his jlowgren/dotfiles, so some cred goes to him as well. ðŸ˜Š
